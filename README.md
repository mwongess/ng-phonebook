# Phonebook

## Angular Screening

### Challenge

1. Use a database or a datastore of your liking for storage. Even mock data in
arrays is fine – but it must be the same datastore for the whole project.
2. You are allowed to use styling templates readily available e.g., Tailwind and
or Bootstrap.
Task.
Please come up with an amazing phonebook software that can help someone to
store their contacts from time to time. The phonebook should have capability to do
the following:
1. List all my contacts sorted in alphabetical order. – User should be able to pick
whether to view as grid or as list.
2. View a single contact.
3. Edit and update a single contact.
4. Delete a contact.
5. Search contacts.
6. Select multiple contacts and delete.
7. On home page allow me to view contacts as list or grid.
The basic fields for the Contact Details will be First Name, Last Name, Email and
Phone Number…feel free to add any of your own liking e.g., Contact Image, Physical
Address ETC.
